## Planning

### WireFrames

- Below are the wireframes I created to plan the design of the website. Using wireframes helped me work towards a design and have a more focused end product.

- __Home Page__

### Colour Scheme

- I have used 3 main colors from the color palette consisting of 5 colors, I have used a series of red, pink and greys.

### Typography

- I have used one main font, [Russo One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Russo+One?preview.text=GET%20STRONG&preview.text_type=custom&classification=Display). This was to stay consistent throughout the whole website and create a familiarity within the website.

### Target Audience

- I aim to target gym goers who want to test their knowledge.
- I aim to target people who don't know much about the gym and want to learn.
- I aim to target all levels of experience to help give knowledge.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to understand the purpose of the site.
- As a user I want to be able to benefit from the site.
- As a user I want to be able to navigate the site with ease.

### Site Aims

- Inform the user about the purpose of the site.

### Features Left to Implement

- Different categories of gym quizzes.

## Testing

### Cross-browser Testing

- I have checked my website works on multiple browsers, such as Firefox, Edge, Opera and Chrome.

### Responsive Design Testing

- My responsive design works as intended on all the browsers I have tested.
- I have used websites such as <https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://codybradbury05.github.io/love-gym/index.html/> to also check whether my responsive design works and looks good.
- I have used the Chrome developer tools to check my responsive design works, testing on all different screen sizes. For example, Galaxy Fold, iPad Mini, Google Nest Hub Max.

### Readability

- I have clarified through myself and others that my design is readable and easy to understand as well as my design being consistent via colours, fonts and images.

### Usability

- I have tested that everything the user can interact with works as intended. As follows, all buttons work on click and give a response when hovered over. My quiz fully works and gives user feedback on whether a question is right, as well as tracks the score and number of questions. The username and score are saved to the high score page.

### Validator Testing

- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)
- No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator#css)
- No errors were found when passing through the website [validatejavascript.com](https://validatejavascript.com/)

### Lighthouse Testing

- I used Lighthouse to test other areas of my website, all tests were completed on the mobile side. Accessibility was lower due to the contrast of colors, not a high enough ration. This is something I could change in the future by using a higher color contrast ratio.

### Bugs

- The first bug I found was my buttons not directing to a new page, this was a file path problem and due to my deploying my page early, I was able to solve this problem.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
  - Due to me deploying the site early, it helped me spot any potential bugs early on the deployed site. This helped me to negate any problems that would have not shown on the live server.
